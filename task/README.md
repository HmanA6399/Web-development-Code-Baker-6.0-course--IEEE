# TODO App

Build a simple `todo` app that helps the user to add his todos and organize it.

## Requirments:-
1. The user can add multiple todos as much as he want.
2. The user can delete a single task he want.
3. When refreshing the page, the todos remains as where it's, and also when deleting one and refresh the page this one goes away.


## Tips:-
- Use `localStorage` to store the items.

__Bonus__: 
- After building the app with `vanilla javascript`, try to refactor it (rebuild it) with `JQuery` and another time with `ES6`.
